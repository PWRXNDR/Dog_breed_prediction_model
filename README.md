# Dog_breed_prediction_model
This repository contains a machine learning model designed to recognize dog breeds. The model was developed using the dataset provided by the Kaggle Dog Breed Identification Competition. The competition's dataset comprises a diverse set of dog images, which has been pivotal in training our model to distinguish among various breeds effectively.
